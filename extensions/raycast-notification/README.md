# Raycast Notification

The HUD notifications of Raycast look super nice! Don't you wish you could use them for everything?

Well, this extension makes it easy to display Raycast notifications via a quicklink, making the beautiful Raycast interface usable for other applications or scripts.

Use it from the terminal with `open -g raycast://extensions/maxnyby/raycast-notification/index?launchType=background&arguments=%7B%22title%22%3A%22Notification%20text%22%7D`. Make sure to URL encode the notification text, and of course, validate your input text before using it on the command line
