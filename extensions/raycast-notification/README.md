# Raycast Notification

The HUD notifications of raycast look super nice! Don't you wish you could use them for everything?

Well, this extension makes it easy to display raycast notifications via a quicklink, making the nice raycast interface usable to other applications or scripts.

Use it from the terminal with `open -g raycast://extensions/maxnyby/raycast-notification/index?launchType=background&arguments=%7Btitle%3A%22notificationtext%22%7D`.
Make sure to url_encode the notificationtext, and of course to validate your input text before using it on the command line.
